Computer Graphics Lab

This repository contains various assignments completed as part of the Computer Graphics course. The assignments are implemented using C++ and the graphics.h library, covering fundamental concepts in computer graphics such as polygon drawing, line clipping, pattern drawing, and transformations.


Assignments Overview
1. Scan Fill Algorithm using Inheritance
Description: This program draws a concave polygon and fills it with a desired color using the scan fill algorithm. The concept of inheritance is applied, where a polygon class inherits from a lines class.
File: CGA1.cpp

3. Cohen-Sutherland Line Clipping Algorithm
Description: This program implements the Cohen-Sutherland line clipping algorithm to clip lines against a rectangular window.
File: CGA2.cpp

3. DDA Line and Bresenham's Circle Drawing Algorithm
Description: This program draws a specific pattern using the DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) line algorithm and Bresenham's circle drawing algorithm, demonstrating the concept of encapsulation.
File: CGA3.cpp

4. Basic 2D Transformations with Operator Overloading
Description: This program performs basic 2D transformations—scaling, translation, and rotation—on a 2D object using operator overloading.
File: CGA4.cpp

5. Koch Fractal Pattern Generation
Description: This program generates fractal patterns using Koch curves.
File: CGA5.cpp

6. Bouncing Ball using Sine Wave and Polymorphism
Description: This program simulates a bouncing ball using a sine wave function, applying the concept of polymorphism.
File: CGA6.cpp
